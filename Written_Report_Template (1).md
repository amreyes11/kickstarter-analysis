# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of the project is to show the difference in performanace for various campaigns in comparison to Louise's launch data specifically launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
####May and June were the top sucessful performers for the year while December was the slowest month.   

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
####The most successful projects were seen during the 1000-4999 goal with also the highest number in failures shown.  The least projects were shown in the range between 45000 to 49999.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
####I had difficulties with trying to figure out how to have the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date hide and disregard the "live" column labels and excluded from the total count.  Also, in the Outcomes Based on Goal Pivot chart and line graph, my x-axis would not populate orderly as shown in my row labels.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
####May and June were the most successful months of the year with very few cancellations in the theater category.  
####December was the least successful month of the year based on the grand total.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
####The goal range of 1000-4999 was the most successful based on the successful percentage in relation to the total number of projects.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
####The dataset is too large and widespread; skewed based on successful, failed and cancelled.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
####Pie graph and / or Stacked bar graph showing the percentages of the outcomes based on goals.
